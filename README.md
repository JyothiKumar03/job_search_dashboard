# Candidate Application Platform Documentation

## Overview

The Candidate Application Platform is a web application designed to help users view job listings, filter jobs based on various criteria, and apply to jobs seamlessly. The platform provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and applying to job opportunities.

## Features

1. **Job Cards**: Each job listing is displayed as a card containing the following information:
   - Job title
   - Company name
   - Location
   - Job description (limited with an option to expand)
   - Experience required
   - Apply button/link

2. **Filters**: Users can refine job listings based on the following criteria:
   - Minimum experience
   - Company name
   - Location
   - Remote/on-site
   - Tech stack
   - Role
   - Minimum base pay

3. **Infinite Scroll**: Implementing infinite scroll allows the platform to load additional job listings automatically as the user scrolls down the page. This provides a seamless browsing experience without the need for a "Load More" button.

4. **Responsive Design**: The platform is designed to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes, including mobile devices. This ensures a consistent user experience across various devices.
